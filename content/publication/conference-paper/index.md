abstract: Waveguide QED simulators are analogue quantum simulators made by quantum emitters interacting with one-dimensional photonic band-gap materials. One of their remarkable features is that they can be used to engineer tunable-range emitter interactions. Here, we demonstrate how these interactions can be a resource to develop more efficient variational quantum algorithms for certain problems. In particular, we illustrate their power in creating wavefunction ansätze that capture accurately the ground state of quantum critical spin models (XXZ and Ising) with less gates and optimization parameters than other variational ansätze based on nearest-neighbor or infinite-range entangling gates. Finally, we study the potential advantages of these waveguide ansätze in the presence of noise. Overall, these results evidence the potential of using the interaction range as a variational parameter and place waveguide QED simulators as a promising platform for variational quantum algorithms.
