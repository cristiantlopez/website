This is the first work of our collaboration with Erez Zohar, from the Racah Institute of Physics. The main motivation for this work comes from a very simple observation: actual quantum systems, specially quantum emitters (such as atoms), usually have more than two states, but typically just two of them are used. Is it possible to harness more of these levels? And what can we do with them? In our article, we propose specific ways to obtain effective photon-mediated interactions between qutrits (that is, systems with three levels) and show how they can be useful to perform quantum simulation of more exotic models or high-dimensional quantum computing.

We consider quantum emitters interacting with photonic modes, that can be either cavity modes or waveguide modes, and drive them with external lasers. Then, under several possible configurations, we derive the corresponding low-energy effective Hamiltonians that lead to different photon-mediated interactions between the emitters. We finally overview their applications in quantum simulation of different systems, such as $Z_3$ LGT.
