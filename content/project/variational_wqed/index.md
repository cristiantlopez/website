Our first work of the NanoQuCo project is finally out! Our objective with this project is to apply the toolbox of Variational Quantum Algorithms to propose schemes specifically tailored to exploit all the resources provided by waveguide-QED setups. 

In this first work, we use the tunable long-range interactions available in waveguide-QED platforms to develop more efficient variational quantum algorithms. We benchmark their power creating the ground states of critical spin models using less gates or optimization parameters than other state-of-the-art variational ans√§tze, leading to an advantage of these platforms if their resources are exploited when designing the circuits.

Our results place waveguide QED simulators as a promising platform to continue exploring variational quantum algorithms. Stay tuned for more news!
