I'm a researcher in quantum technologies at QUINFOG (IFF-CSIC) under the supervision of Alejandro Gonz√°lez-Tudela and Diego Porras. My research interests include quantum computation and quantum simulation, quantum optics and nanophotonics, and the interplay between quantum hardware and software.

I explore the different ways that atoms and other quantum emitters interact with light and how to harness them to improve current quantum technologies üñ•Ô∏è‚öõÔ∏è.
